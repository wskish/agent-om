I want to test the limits of what is possible with an htmx app with alpine.js and Tailwind.  i want to make an htmx version of this app (basically turn main.py into a web ui).  It should be as interactive  and well styled as possible with an htmx app.  Ideally this should be a single python file main_htmx with minimal other asset files as required for styling, js, etc.  ideally it should re-use my existing ai_toolchat and ai_toolchat_claude implementations as-is.
